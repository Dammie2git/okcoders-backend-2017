Class Preparation
====

Welcome the 2017 Tulsa OKCoders Backend course!

You will need a few pieces of software for class, all of which are free:
- An IDE/editor ([Atom](https://atom.io/), Sublime, etc.  Atom is preferred)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v8 preferred)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center) (MongoDB server, v3.4.5 preferred)
- [RoboMongo](https://robomongo.org) (MongoDB GUI)


You will need also need to create SSH keys, or *Secure Shell* keys for access to GitHub.

Instructions are provided for Mac and Windows computers.  If you are a Linux user, most of the Mac instructions will apply.

If you are not familiar with the command line, expect to spend a couple hours on this.

Refer to the [**mac-setup**](https://github.com/sergei202/okcoders-backend-2017/blob/master/week1-prep/mac-setup.md) or [**windows-setup**](https://github.com/sergei202/okcoders-backend-2017/blob/master/week1-prep/windows-setup.md) file for additional instructions depending on your OS.
